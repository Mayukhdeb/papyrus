<h1 class="title">Why I made Papyrus</h1>
</header>
<p>In the last few years, I’ve used jekyll, hugo and sometimes plain html for my github pages websites. They were good, but it was always a pain to figure out the exact syntax for stuff like latex math etc. Plus the themes were not very customizable. Therefore I decided to take matters into my own hands and build a tiny framework which is “just enough” for my own needs.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: I was tired of using the existing static site builders. Plus I was bored :)</p>
